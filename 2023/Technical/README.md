### Everyday C# - A blend of modern and time tested features
Bill Wagner 

Everyday C#&#xD;&#xA;C# innovates quickly. Your team needs to chart a course to adopt new features most applicable to you and your team. Everyday C# defines the subset of C# we expect developers to learn first when they begin learning C#. We include the latest features when they are ones that we expect most developers will use. You can examine the set of features included (and excluded) as a starting point for what features to adopt in your application. You can use the same process we used to define your team&#x27;s version of &quot;Everyday C#&quot;. You&#x27;ll adapt our process to match your environment. This gives your team guidance on when to adopt each new language innovation, and when to continue your current practices.

### Concurrent Hosted Service in .NET 8
Saeed Esmaeelinejad 

Before .NET 8, hosted services were started and stopped sequentially, with each service&#x27;s StartAsync and StopAsync methods awaiting completion before the next service&#x27;s methods were triggered. This default behavior, though mostly fine, could cause problems, particularly with slow services delaying the application&#x27;s overall start or shutdown. In .NET 8, developers now have the option to enable concurrent start and/or stop behavior for registered hosted services using the new properties in HostOptions. This allows services to start and stop concurrently, potentially improving application startup and shutdown times.

### We are not just a .NET Community, we run our community on .NET
Augustine Correa 

We are the largest Open-Source Software [OSS] community with its longest running (&gt; 10 years) tech meetup in Bombay. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And as such we are mostly houseful [&#xD;&#xA;https://twitter.com/hackmum/status/1694780944778186885?s=20]. As a community that is committed to diversity and inclusiveness, most of our efforts and time is expended on registration triaging. And the next biggest friction in our meetup management is to ensure attendee check-ins and check-outs for building/civic code adherence  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So as a tech community, to solve this, we did the only thing we love to do: build an app. That too on .NET 8. We will tell you why .net8 is the best .NET yet and share what are the gotchas we had to look out for.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And we wouldn&#x27;t be an OSS community, if it&#x27;s not on GitHub [https://github.com/HackerspaceMumbai/Visage/issues/69]. Contributors welcome &#x1F64F;

### Understanding Role-Based Access Control with ASP.NET Web APIs
Aditya Oberai 

When you&#x27;re building an application and want to restrict access to resources and information for different kinds of users, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is one of the best, most structured models you can implement. One of the simplest ways to achieve RBAC in web APIs is by leveraging JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and adding roles as claims.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this session, join in as we discuss the importance of API security and how you can use JWTs to implement the RBAC pattern in an ASP.NET Web API and better secure your API endpoints.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

### From Zero to Million: How Amateur Developers and Infrastructure Engineers Built a Million-Dollar App
Werner Rall 

Join us for an exciting presentation as we dive deep into the journey of an unlikely team of amateur developers and infrastructure engineers who crafted a million-dollar app using .NET and PowerShell. Starting with nothing more than a simple idea and their combined skills, this team harnessed the power of .NET to develop a robust and scalable application that not only caught the eye of industry veterans but also generated over $1 million in revenue for Microsoft. In this talk, we will walk through the challenges, breakthroughs, and technical details of the app development process. We will showcase how PowerShell was utilized to automate the creation and management of Azure resources, and how this contributed to the team&#x27;s ability to rapidly iterate and scale the app. With valuable insights and key takeaways, we are hoping this session will inspire developers of all levels to explore the possibilities of .NET, PowerShell, and Azure, and demonstrate that with the right tools and a dedicated team, even amateur developers can achieve extraordinary success

### From IL Weaving to Source Generators, the Realm story
Ferdinando Papale 

Intermediate Language (IL) Weaving is a powerful technique that allows to greatly simplify the experience of developers using the .NET Realm SDK by hiding a fair amount of complexity from end-users.&#xD;&#xA;Working with a weaver, though, is tedious, error prone and the resulting code is a black box. These are some of the reasons that convinced us to migrate to Source Generators, a feature introduced in .NET 5 that allows to produce code on the fly during compilation.&#xD;&#xA;This talk will go through the reasons why IL Weaving was used in the first place, our long journey switching to Source Generators and why they do not yet satisfy all our needs.&#xD;&#xA;

### Two ways of migrating old ASP.NET web apps to .NET 7/8
Tomas Herceg 

Legacy ASP.NET apps updated to ASP.NET Core can benefit from improved performance and access to the latest web development features and capabilities.&#xD;&#xA;It is not easy to migrate a non-trivial web app - the migration must be done incrementally.&#xD;&#xA;In this session, I&#x27;ll talk about two ways of doing the migration:&#xD;&#xA;* The first way involves creating a new app aside and configuring YARP to forward traffic to already migrated pages to the new app.&#xD;&#xA;* The second way uses an open-source framework DotVVM which can be added directly to the .NET Framework project and allows switching to the .NET 7/8 when the migration is complete.&#xD;&#xA;I&#x27;ll share a lot of practical examples and my personal experience with both methods of migration.

### Design UI agnostic cross-platform applications with .NET
Dan Ciprian Ardelean 

One of the first questions I hear from my clients, when they are starting developing a new cross platform applications with .NET, is: What framework should I use? Xamarin.Forms which is stable, MAUI which is the new child but still missing some things. But wait there is also Uno Platform and AvaloniaUI.&#xD;&#xA;The question is not wrong but maybe you could approach the problem in a different way? What if you could design your application to depend as little as possible on the UI framework thus making it easier to migrate from one UI framework to another without the need to rewrite everything.&#xD;&#xA;In this session I will show some strategies that you can use when you are developing a cross-platform application with .NET that should make testing, maintenance and migration easier .

### Experimental C# Interceptors: AOT &amp; Performance for free
Stefan P&#xF6;lz 

C# 12.0 - shipped with .NET 8.0 - brings us a new experimental language feature: Interceptors. An interceptor is basically the inverse of a goto statement that enables the Roslyn compiler to replace reflection-based call sites with specialized implementations. Combined with (incremental) source generators, codebases become more Native AOT-friendly and can unlock better performance. Let&#x27;s inspect this new concept in detail and see it in action.

### Building beautiful Blazor apps with Tailwind CSS
Chris Sainty 

Tailwind CSS has been growing in popularity for some time. It&#x2019;s fast becoming one of the top frameworks to use when styling applications. It offers a different approach to the traditional frameworks like Bootstrap&#x2014;utility based styling. Rather than using prebuilt components&#x2014;which result in your application looking like a lot of others on the web&#x2014;you can tailor your design by applying small focused CSS classes resulting in a unique style for your app.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this code focused talk, you will learn how to bring the power of Tailwind CSS to your Blazor applications. We&#x2019;ll start off with a brief introduction to Tailwind. Then we&#x2019;ll get into some code and see how we can integrate Tailwind with Blazor. For the rest of the time, we&#x2019;ll explore the various features of Tailwind and see just how beautiful we can make our Blazor app!

### It&#x27;s C# All The Way Down! Using .NET for home automation with IoT devices
Sammo Gabay 

In this presentation, I demonstrate using .NET nanoFramework on a microcontroller along with .NET runtime on a Raspberry Pi to control home automation. The microcontroller acts a beacon relaying button presses from a repurposed Gravis PC GamePad to a microservice running on the Pi, which handles calling the various APIs needed to control smart home devices such as connected air conditioners and lighting. Echoing the expression &#x201C;Turtles all the Way Down&#x201D;, we see how C# can be leveraged across layers in an IoT solution.

### CQRS with Event Sourcing using the &#x201C;Critter Stack&#x201D;
Jeremy Miller 

Do you have a system where you think would be a good fit for a CQRS architecture that also uses Event Sourcing for at least part of its persistence strategy? Are you intimidated by the potential complexity of that kind of approach? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fear not, using a combination of the Postgresql-backed Marten (https://martendb.io) library for event sourcing and its newer friend Wolverine (https://wolverine.netlify.app) for command handling and asynchronous messaging, I&#x27;ll show you how you can quickly get started with both CQRS and Event Sourcing. Once we get past the quick start, I&#x27;ll show you how the Critter Stack&#x27;s unique approach to the &quot;Decider&quot; pattern will help you create robust command handlers with very little code ceremony while still enjoying easy testability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moving beyond basic command handling, I&#x27;ll show you how to reliably subscribe to and publish the events or other messages created by your command handlers through Wolverine&#x27;s durable outbox and direct subscriptions to Marten&#x27;s event storage.
