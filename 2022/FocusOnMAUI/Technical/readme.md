### Setting up shop for .NET MAUI

[Gerald Versluis](https://twitter.com/jfversluis) 

With all this content about .NET MAUI it&#x27;s easy to forget that there comes one step before building amazing apps: setting up your development environment! In this session I will give you an overview of what is involved with setting up your dev box to start developing with .NET MAUI. After this session you will know what to install, how to configure the pieces together and how to run your first .NET MAUI app!

### Authenticate users and call protected APIs in your MAUI app

[Sameer Khandekar](https://twitter.com/sameerIOTApps) 

Securing customer information is of paramount importance. Come and learn how, using MSAL.NET, you can add authentication of users to your MAUI app, and call a protected web API on behalf of the signed-in user! This session briefly explains OAuth 2.0, and how your app can use MSAL.NET to sign-in a user and get an access token for a protected API. It covers both Azure Active Directory and Azure AD B2C users. B2C user should be able to login in the app using their Facebook, Google, and Microsoft accounts.

### From web to native with .NET MAUI and Blazor

[Dan Roth](https://twitter.com/danroth27) 

Blazor uses the latest open web standards to enable full stack web development with .NET. But what if you need to build a native client app? Blazor has expanded beyond the web to enable building native client apps using a hybrid of web technologies and .NET. In this session we&#x2019;ll look at the new Blazor Hybrid support in .NET MAUI for building cross-platform native client apps for mobile, desktop using your existing Blazor web UI components.

### Code Reuse with .NET MAUI

[Sam Basu](https://twitter.com/samidip) 

While .NET MAUI is the next generation of .NET cross-platform development, there are plenty of ways to reuse existing code &amp; skills. Migration &amp; reusability from Xamarin.Forms to .NET MAUI should be natural - tools can help. .NET code &amp; styling can now be shared seamlessly between web, desktop &amp; mobile. Blazor is very welcome in .NET MAUI and developers can do all the native mobile/desktop things with Blazor code, while reusing shared Blazor components between web/.NET MAUI/WPF/WinForms. JavaScript code with Angular or React is also welcome on native mobile/desktop apps with .NET MAUI. Let&#x27;s explore the future of portability &amp; developer productivity with .NET MAUI.

[Luce Carter](https://twitter.com/LuceCarter1) 

Storage of data is a core part of of many applications. Historically, when you ask developers about databases, they will talk to you about SQLite. But this is not the only way! In this session, Luce will introduce you to the powerful Developer Data Platform of MongoDB and how their cloud-hosted products, including Realm can allow you to easily store, query and manipulate data, with automatic online/offline sync, authentication and more. You will go away feeling more confident to turn your back on SQL and embrace the power of the document data model!

### C# and LINQ for Data Access with EF Core

[Jeremy Likness](https://twitter.com/JeremyLikness) 

Forget magic strings, hand-written SQL queries and unfamiliar SDKs to deal with local data in your .NET MAUI apps. Entity Framework Core, also known as EF Core, is an object-mapper that empowers .NET developers to work with databases using the .NET languages and type system they know and love. In this session, learn how EF Core simplifies working with a cross-platform SQLite database in a .NET MAUI app and handles everything from complex queries to multiple updates that execute with a single line of developer code. Discover how client developers can use the same APIs that drive most REST, GraphQL, and gRPC backends on the server!

###  Upgrading your JS Apps with .NET MAUI

[Alyssa Nicoll](https://twitter.com/AlyssaNicoll) 

As a JS girl in a .NET World, I have recently started learning the power of MAUI. MAUI is a .NET framework used for creating native mobile and desktop apps. I learned how to utilize a WebView inside a .NET MAUI application to wrap any sort of web app I desired (Angular, React, Vue, you name it!) and deploy it with the power of MAUI to any platform under the sun. I’m excited to show you how to do this — bridging two worlds has never been more fun!
