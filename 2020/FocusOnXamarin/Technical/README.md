### Visualize Your Data (CollectionView, CarouselView, & Beyond)
A big part of any app is visualizing data. With recent versions of Xamarin.Forms a lot of new controls have been added and updated with controls to do just that. In this session you will learn what these controls are, how they can be used and more importantly; how to use them to make your app look gorgeous.

### Xamarin Productivity to the Max
Xamarin developers are creating beautiful mobile apps faster than ever. The Xamarin tooling team has been hard at work making improvements to every aspect of the .NET mobile development process. We've made it more intuitive to write code, faster to build and deploy your apps, and easier to iterate on your UIs with a wide variety of tools and features.

Join Maddy Leger, Xamarin Program Manager, to learn about all of the ways to become even more productive writing Xamarin apps with some of the latest and greatest tools, like XAML Hot Reload for Xamarin.Forms, the XAML editor on Visual Studio for Mac, and more!

### Going Reactive with Reactive Extensions & UI
Mobile developers have some unique constraints that we have to solve for.  We develop in a world where we respond to events, fire asynchronous tasks all on a device that may not have the resources available to complete these tasks. 

This talk will show you why you want to use Reactive Extensions and ReactiveUI to solve some of those concerns in a declarative manner, that makes it easier for you to focus on business value, rather than technical debt.

### All Things Xamarin.Forms Shell
Have you ever felt overwhelmed by all the different pages, rolled your eyes at the navigation page, and thought to yourself `this can't be the only way to do this when trying to customize something as simple as the navigation bar? If any of these things sound like you, then you're going to love the new Xamarin.Forms Shell.

Shell is the new replacement for every single one of your Xamarin.Forms pages. It provides out-of-the-box infrastructure to deliver the features of all existing pages, plus customization,  simplified navigation, and additional layers of customization. In this session, we'll look at how quickly you can get going with Shell and then how easy it is to customize for your designs and scenarios.
